redux notes --- 


npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux 



1- create a slice which will hold all the reducers 




2- create store.js in the store folder

3- wrap the app.js with the <Provider store= {store} > </Provider> 



4 - importing the actions form the store in the OptionsBar component 

import {select} from '../store/store' 

calling the action select which will call the reducer that will chnage the state . 

5 - to dispatch action we require a hook called as useDispatch()
    
    const dispatch = useDispatch();


6- create a fxn whichi will handle dispatch - 
ex - 
    const handleSelect = (time) =>{
        dispatch(select(time))
    }


all done -- now getting the stored data . 


7 -we use  useSelector to get the stored data .
